I'm a final year student at NIT Warangal, India, pursuing a B.Tech. Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently the lead programmer for the  game development startup GBit Studios, which was incubated at NIT Warangal. I am extremely interested in pursuing higher education, starting with a master's degree. My primary areas of research have thus far included object detection and tracking, but I am keen on exploring other aspects of computer vision in graduate school.
